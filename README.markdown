# Sublime Text 2 Magnificent Theme

Features

- One theme fit all.
- Adaptable Theme. Most of the UI will adapt to the color Scheme you're using. If you're using a dark scheme the theme will try no to use bright colors. Same happens for Light schemes!
- Tries not to loook too similar to chrome to create some contrast tool-wise.
