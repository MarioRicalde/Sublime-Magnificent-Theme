![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4651065/screenshots/2012/2/27-16h26m44s.png)

Features

- One theme fit all.
- Adaptable Theme. Most of the UI will adapt to the color Scheme you're using. If you're using a dark scheme the theme will try no to use bright colors. Same happens for Light schemes!
- Tries not to loook too similar to chrome to create some contrast tool-wise.


#### Install it

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages`:

    git clone git@github.com:kuroir/Sublime-Magnificent-Theme.git "Theme - Sublime Magnificent"

#### Activate it

`Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`

Add this to the theme:
